Each episode we focus on one idea from computer science and try to understand how it fits into our world as professional programmers.

This episode we welcome our guest host, Sergey Astretsov, to discuss the paper "Coverage and Its Discontents" about the use of code coverage as a proxy for test effectiveness. From there we debate when and why to test, discuss the relationship between commenting and testing, and generally digress.

<p>This episode we welcome our guest host, Sergey Astretsov, to discuss the paper “Coverage and Its Discontents” about the use of code coverage as a proxy for test effectiveness. From there we debate when and why to test, discuss the relationship between commenting and testing, and generally digress.</p>

<p>In this episode we discuss functional reactive programming as represented by the Elm language, and how it’s influencing web development through the recent popularity of ReactJS</p>
